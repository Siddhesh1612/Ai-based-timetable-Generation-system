# EduTime AI  
### AI-Based Timetable Generation System Aligned with NEP 2020

---

## 📌 Overview
EduTime AI is an AI-assisted timetable generation system designed to support **NEP 2020–aligned multidisciplinary education structures**.  
It helps academic institutions generate **flexible, clash-free, and resource-efficient timetables** that accommodate cross-disciplinary courses, skill-based modules, shared faculty, and evolving academic policies.

Traditional timetable systems are rigid, manual, and department-centric. EduTime AI addresses this gap by introducing **rule-aware, explainable optimization** for modern higher-education needs.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Under **NEP 2020**, institutions must enable:
- Multidisciplinary course combinations  
- Flexible electives and minors  
- Multiple entry–exit options  
- Skill-based learning modules  
- Shared faculty, labs, and classrooms  

However, existing timetable systems struggle with:
- Course clashes across departments  
- Reduced student flexibility  
- Faculty overload or idle time  
- Inefficient use of labs and classrooms  
- Incomplete implementation of NEP 2020 objectives  

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters
A smart timetable is the **foundation** of multidisciplinary education.

Poor scheduling leads to:
- Limited student choice  
- Poor faculty workload distribution  
- Wasted infrastructure  
- Administrative inefficiency  

EduTime AI enables institutions to **practically implement NEP 2020**, not just comply with it on paper.

---

## ✨ What’s New
Most existing solutions are static and rule-based. EduTime AI introduces:
- Cross-disciplinary scheduling support  
- Student-choice–aware optimization  
- Explainable decision-making for administrators  
- Configurable rules aligned with NEP 2020  

The system is designed to be **adaptive, transparent, and scalable**.

---

## 🧠 AI Approach (Explainable, Not Black-Box)
EduTime AI focuses on **practical intelligence**, not opaque automation.

The system uses:
- Constraint-based validation (no clashes, capacity checks, availability rules)
- Optimization through iterative scoring and improvement
- Conflict detection using graph-based logic
- Adaptive rescheduling for dynamic changes

> The goal is **trustworthy and explainable scheduling**, suitable for real academic environments.

---

## 👥 Target Users
- Universities and autonomous colleges  
- Multidisciplinary institutions (NEP 2020)  
- Academic planners and timetable coordinators  
- EdTech platforms supporting higher education  

Designed to scale across **multi-institution and hybrid learning models**.

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

### Risks
- Rapid policy changes  
- Inconsistent or incomplete academic data  
- Resistance to automated systems  

### Mitigation
- Policy-driven rule engine configurable to NEP updates  
- Human-in-the-loop approval process  
- Transparent explanations for every scheduling decision

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Prototype)

**Frontend**
- Streamlit  

**Backend**
- Python  
- FastAPI  

**Data**
- JSON (synthetic/mock data)

**Logic**
- Rule-based optimization  
- Scoring-based timetable evaluation  

---

## 🚀 Project Status
🚧 **Prototype / Early-stage Development**

This project is currently focused on:
- Rapid prototyping  
- Demonstration of feasibility  
- Academic and hackathon evaluation  

Future versions can integrate real institutional data, advanced optimization, and live system integration.
